### Experiment 1: Say "hello" to the BBC micro:bit ###

micro:bit will display a :) emoji when button A is pressed, and will write the words, "hello!" when button B is pressed.

#### Reflection ####

This experiment was really useful to familiarise and introduce me to the micro:bit. I got a feel for how the interface works and tried out some of the options available to me. I learnt that the micro:bit follows the idea of inputs and outputs, if you do A, B will happen. 

As for real world application, this experiment could relate to keyboards, where you press a key and a letter is displayed, or a scanner at a store where a barcode is scanned and an item is registered. 

### Experiment 2: Using a light sensor & analog inputs ###

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, I was first introduced to the breadboard, along with phototransistors, resistors, and jumper wires. I also learnt about analog readings.
To summarise what I learnt:
A phototransistor can detect light levels. There is also a small phototransistor on the micro:bit. The jumper wires connects the circuit from 0V to 3V. The more light on the phototransistor, the more electricity in can conduct.  When the light level goes down, the resistor helps pull the amount of voltage down to 0. 

Analog reading:
The amount of voltage on a pin is read and converted to a number between 0 and 1023. This is then used in the coding with an 'if' statement to create an output over a certain threshold.

This experiment could apply to phones that use light sensors to dim or brighten a screen automatically according to the light level it detects. They could also be used to gather data about how much light is in a certain area, where a counter records every time the light level exceeds a certain threshold. It could also be used to detect the absense of light due to shadow. For example, a phototransistor using a similar LED display could display an image every time a box is opened, because opening the box would expose the phototransistor to the light.
