#### Reflection ####

This experiment was really useful to familiarise and introduce me to the micro:bit. I got a feel for how the interface works and tried out some of the options available to me. I learnt that the micro:bit follows the idea of inputs and outputs, if you do A, B will happen. 

As for real world application, this experiment could relate to keyboards, where you press a key and a letter is displayed, or a scanner at a store where a barcode is scanned and an item is registered. 

### Experiment 2: Using a light sensor & analog inputs ###
